Steps Taken to Fix the Problem:

1. Reproduced the issue by executing the customerâ€™s provided code and encountered the same `NoneType` error.
2. Reviewed the stack trace and identified that the issue occurred when attempting to access the `transcript.utterances` property, indicating a problem with the `transcript` object.
3. Debugged the `transcript` object by adding a print statement, revealing an error message indicating an invalid `audio_url`.
4. Reviewed AssemblyAI API documentation to confirm the expected input format for the `audio_url` parameter.
5. Identified the root cause that the provided URL pointed to a podcast webpage rather than a direct link to an audio file.
6. Updated the `audio_url` in the code with a direct link to the audio file, then re-ran the script to confirm the issue was resolved and that speaker labels and transcript were successfully generated.

Lessons learned:

1. Validate the inputs and ensure that any URLs passed to the API point directly to audio files, as indirect links (e.g., podcast webpages) are not supported.
2. Pay close attention to the error messages as they often provide key insights for debugging.
3. Review the API documentation to help clarify the expected input format and API requirements.
4. Add print statements and check outputs at key steps to diagnose and resolve issues.
